# 🔗 Wallet Connection Testing Guide

## ✅ Wallet Connection is Now Working!

Your PakTaxChain application now has fully functional wallet connection capabilities.

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Test Wallet Connection

#### **Option A: MetaMask (Recommended)**
1. Install [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/)
2. Create/import a wallet
3. Click "Connect Wallet" button on PakTaxChain
4. Select "MetaMask" from the dropdown
5. Approve connection in MetaMask popup

#### **Option B: Any Injected Wallet**
1. Install any Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" button
3. Select "Injected" option
4. Approve connection

### 3. Test Network Switching
The app supports these networks:
- **Hardhat Local** (for development)
- **Polygon Mainnet** 
- **Polygon Mumbai** (testnet)
- **Ethereum Mainnet**

### 4. Features After Connection

Once connected, you'll see:
- ✅ Wallet address displayed in header
- ✅ "Go to Dashboard" button appears
- ✅ Dropdown with wallet options:
  - Copy address
  - View on Etherscan
  - Disconnect wallet
- ✅ Access to auth-required pages (Dashboard, Pay Tax, Admin)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Supported Connectors
- **MetaMask**: Most popular Web3 wallet
- **Injected**: Any wallet that injects into window.ethereum

### Chains Configured
- Hardhat Local (Chain ID: 31337)
- Polygon (Chain ID: 137)  
- Polygon Mumbai (Chain ID: 80001)
- Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)

### Smart Contract Integration Ready
The wallet connection is fully integrated with your PakTaxChain smart contracts:
- Connected to the right network (Hardhat local for development)
- Contract addresses configured in `.env.local`
- Ready for tax payments and interactions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connect Wallet" button not responding**
   - Make sure you have a Web3 wallet installed
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Wallet not detected**
   - Install MetaMask or another Web3 wallet
   - Ensure the wallet extension is enabled
   - Try the "Injected" option

3. **Wrong network**
   - Switch to Hardhat Local network in your wallet
   - Add custom network: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, Chain ID: 31337

4. **Connection rejected**
   - Check if you rejected the connection in wallet
   - Try connecting again
   - Clear wallet permissions and retry

## 🎯 Next Steps

Now that wallet connection works, you can:

1. **Deploy contracts locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run node        # Start Hardhat node
   npm run deploy      # Deploy contracts
   ```

2. **Test smart contract interactions**
3. **Implement tax payment functionality**
4. **Add more wallet connectors if needed**

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never share your private keys
- Use testnet for development
- The app only requests wallet connection, not private keys
- All transactions require explicit user approval

**🎉 Congratulations! Your wallet connection is now fully functional!**

You are seeing this error because your project is missing the required **Supabase environment variables**. Specifically, the following variables must be set in your environment (usually in a `.env.local` or `.env` file in your project root):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

---

## **How to Fix**

1. **Find your Supabase project URL and anon key:**
   - Go to your [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/).
   - Select your project.
   - Go to **Project Settings > API**.
   - Copy the **Project URL** and **anon public key**.

2. **Create or update your `.env.local` file in your project root:**

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://nkchwtqgwtpktqpwlslk.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im5rY2h3dHFnd3Rwa3RxcHdsc2xrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTI0MTU1ODYsImV4cCI6MjA2Nzk5MTU4Nn0._P0lDluH1N6ZbgFpVDnfr48GIkCHPpeUya3i4Wd-12k
   ```

3. **Restart your dev server:**
   - Stop the server (`Ctrl+C` in terminal)
   - Run `npm run dev` again

---

## **Why This Happens**
Your code in `lib/supabaseClient.js` checks for these variables and throws an error if they are missing, to prevent accidental misconfiguration.

---

## **If you do not want to use Supabase (for local/dev only):**
- You can comment out or mock the Supabase logic, but for full functionality, it’s best to set up a free Supabase project.

---

**Once you add these variables and restart, the error will be resolved. If you need help setting up Supabase or want to use a different backend, let me know!**
